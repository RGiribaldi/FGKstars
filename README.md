Here I provide a library of processed observational spectra for calibration purposes
- The Sun folder contains the Kitt Peak National Observatory spectrum (Kurucz 2005, Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana Supplementi 8, 189), homogenised to resolution R = 340500, re-normalised, merged, and re-sampled to 0.01 Angstrom. The original files can be found in http://kurucz.harvard.edu/sun/fluxatlas2005/
