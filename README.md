# FGKstars
Here I provide a library of processed observational spectra for calibration purposes
- The Sun folder contains the Kitt Peak National Observatory spectra (Kurucz 2005, Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana Supplementi 8, 189), homogenised to resolution R = 340500, re-normalised, and merged. For confortability it was divided in two sections. The original files I used can be found in http://kurucz.harvard.edu/sun/fluxatlas2005/
- The Halpha folder contains profiles of solar-type FKG stars normalised with the procedure in Giribaldi et al. (2019, A&A, 624, A10). They have R = 45 000 and signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 200.
