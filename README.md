# FGKstars

Here I provide a library of normalised and non-normalised observational spectra around the Balmer Halpha line for calibration purposes.
If you use these spectra in your scientific production, I suggest the following citation text:
"These are the European Southern Observatory (ESO) spectra of the so called TITANS metal-poor reference stars. These were extracted from the ESO public archive and processed in Giribaldi et al. 2021A&A...650A.194G (dwarfs) and Giribaldi et al. 2023A&A...679A.110G (red giants) appying the method exposed in detail in Giribaldi et al. 2019A&A...624A..10G."
The reference accurate temperatures determined are listed in Table 2 and 3 in Giribaldi et al. 2021A&A...650A.194G and Table 2 in Giribaldi et al. 2023A&A...679A.110G.

- The Sun folder contains the Kitt Peak National Observatory spectrum (Kurucz 2005, Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana Supplementi 8, 189), homogenised to resolution R = 340500, re-normalised, merged, and re-sampled to 0.01 Angstrom. The original files can be found in http://kurucz.harvard.edu/sun/fluxatlas2005/
