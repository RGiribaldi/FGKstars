Here I provide a library of processed observational spectra for calibration purposes
- The Sun folder contains the Kitt Peak National Observatory spectra (Kurucz 2005, Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana Supplementi 8, 189), homogenised to resolution R = 340500, re-normalised, and merged. For confortability it was divided in two sections. The original files can be found in http://kurucz.harvard.edu/sun/fluxatlas2005/
